2. "It only takes an infinite-RTT to attain happiness in life."
3. [OBEY] + [WORK HARD] + [PRAY] = "Live long and prosper."
4. "Life is definitely not easy, however it's not hard if you try."
5. "If Someone's happiness is your happiness, then you really love them."
6. "Be the person you want to find. Don't be a nickel out here looking for a dime."
7. ASAP! Always Say A Prayer: "God, our Father, If it is your will, walk through my house and take away all my worries and illnesses and please watch over and heal my family in Jesus name, Amen."
8. Persistence. Patience. Passion.
9. Replicate. Reuse. Reiterate.
