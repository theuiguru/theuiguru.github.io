Today was an interesting day spent in the city. First, I woke up to the sound of my alarm at 6AM to snooze it and go back to sleep, until I hear the sound of my mom's voice waking me up at around 6:40AM (The Big Bang Theory's Howard Wolowitz's mom's voice). I then get ready and start heading out to pick up a girl from my church, (wait for it...she's younger) to then go on our way to another parish member's house for us to get a lift from him all the way to St. Mary's Jackson Heights church. On our way there, we made a pit stop at a local dunkin donuts and got breakfast, and then headed out to the church. When we arrive, we start chit-chatting with other fellow parish reps. Next, we went inside the sanctuary for morning prayers and a parish rep meeting about different matters and such (Oh by the way, did you know New York will be hosting another leadership camp in 2015?!...shhh, don't tell anyone yet!). We start heading into the basement of the church to start preparing lunch bags for "people who are homeless" as a #Feed500 support (I added #Feed50 as the title because we only prepared fifty) with peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, a snack and a water in them.<br>
<br>
We all finally start heading out to walk to the subway train station (7 train) all the way down to Times Square. When we arrive, I finally looked up and saw the 2014 lighted sign up on top (as seen on tv on new years day), and of course we bump into Mario along the way (he/she sounded just like him). Next, we all separated into designated groups and walk a lot farther to 46th street. My group, however, came across some interesting homeless people. Some of my group mates said I got a tad bit more excited than I usually am about spotting homeless people on the streets. Until we came across a guy named Dirk (later he said Derrick, identity theft crisis perhaps?) and started bashing up on politics and how this world is so messed up (of course he used words I will not use publicly on the web), but it got me wondering that he's like anyone else, being frustrated at the miseries of government, economy and such. Later he said he got accused at a local library for being a bad guy for something I wasn't too sure of. But he's certainly right, government is screwing us over. He said he was from the Russian Orthodox faith and an immigrant too. I was a bit surprised at the fact that he also quoted St. John Chrysostom. After we talked, I spent for a coffee to give to him because he wanted one so bad (he said he'll pay me back, one day). But then again, it suddenly hit me, as Bobby Varghese (area councilman) pointed out, these people are just like us, their behaviors, actions and deeds. The only thing is that they look funny. I remember talking to him within the group and a couple walked by and smirked (S.M.H. = Shakin' My Head.) After that, we got food off of the biryani cart, for the first time, that Bobby always craves for, which wasn't so bad. Finally, we headed back to the church and we were on our way home. Here are some pictures from today, by the way:</div>
