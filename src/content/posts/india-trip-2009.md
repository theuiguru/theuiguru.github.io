On Tuesday, August 4 went to JFK airport to head off to the motherland, aka Kerala, with the family via Kuwait Airways. Made pit stops along the way at London and Kuwait. Arrived there on Thursday morning, being picked up at the airport by my uncle, Sabuchayan. Got to see and hang out with my appachen and rest of the family for about three weeks. Toured around the many places of Kerala, including different homes, churches, restaurants, and of course the housing boat and Tamil-Nadu (southern tip of India). All of the homes now are kind of nice and comforting. Never forget some of the excellent and delicious food I've eaten. I've also learned a lot and gotten some great advice from my very wise appachen.<br /><br />Anyway, I felt kind of blessed being there knowing more about my family heritage and what not. Overall it was an amazing and blessed experience for me, and would want to go back again!
