I had fun this past weekend. My cousin came here from Philadelphia, and we attended Dennis Mathai's ordination (Rev.Dn.Daniel Mathai...aka...Dennis chemachen), at St. Mary's, West Sayville, NY. It was truly an experience to attend to one of these occasions in the church. I saw some friends that I've talked to. On Sunday, we had english qurbana service, along with Dennis chem spoke to us, in his sermon, about the blind man healed by Jesus Christ. Overall, I had a fun and blessed weekend!
