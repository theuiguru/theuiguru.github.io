<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
I design my family websites for updating various information and get in touch with the super highway of communications. I also update the Levittown Division Avenue High School's website, where a group of students in one class update various sections of the site. I help out with the Anonymous website, which is a christian group spreading the Word of God. I also made my church website and updated it and just recently I created a HoMeBoYs website. I usually update these sites once a month.</div>
