This year's Christmas was sweet. I had my aunt from India and cousins from Canada come over and spend the Christmas weekend with my family. On Christmas Eve, my family and I went to TGIFriday's for dinner. Then on Christmas, I went to church for christmas service at 8AM, participated and received Holy Qurbana, saw some amazing performances by the sunday school kids, and ate lunch, plus chit-chatted with a few friends at church. I went over to my cousin's, Sanuchacha, house for the family christmas party. There we just hung out by talking, praying, and eating together. After that, we had presents to open from our secret santas. I, however, got a pretty sweet formal wear from Sonsychachi, which was <em>Calvin Klein and Perry Ellis </em>shirt and tie. Overall, I had an awesome Christmas this year, got to spend time with my family and friends.
