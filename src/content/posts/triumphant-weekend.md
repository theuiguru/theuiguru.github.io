This past Friday at 3PM, I finally passed my road test, in Wantagh, with zero points off. I was amazingly shocked at the fact that I had a perfect score because I thought I messed up, but I didn't. Later on, went off to dinner with the family at <em>Friendly's</em>.<br /><br />Anyway, yesterday, I went to the mall at night, dropped off by my parents, to spend some time alone shopping. I shopped at <em>Hollister </em>and <em>American Eagle</em>, and purchased some decent clothes. Then, had dinner at home, with family, which was brought from Wendy's.<br /><br />Today, went to church, then off to my cousin, Alex's house, and went straight home. After some while, I went to our usual family prayer meetings at Priya's house, in Syosset, did the usual routine, ate some delicious food, and chit-chatted a bit. Overall, this was just another fantastic weekend. Well, anyway, it was fun while it lasted, now back to my studying for Java exam tomorrow.
