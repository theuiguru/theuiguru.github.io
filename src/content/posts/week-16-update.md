So anyway this past week was very weary from the fantastic wedding weekend I've had with my family. I've been thinking about it these past days, especially during school. Also on Saturday, I went to church for the second faith-study series on the Holy Qurbana, then today went to church, relaxed at home a bit, and finally went to my cousin, Rencha and Bavan(chahch)'s house in Queens, where Erica was as well. Overall, it was a pretty decent week.
