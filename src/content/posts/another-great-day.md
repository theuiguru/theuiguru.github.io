Today, I have seen three movies. This morning, I have seen <em>Evan Almighty</em>, with Steve Carell and Lauren Graham, it was about the story of Noah and learned that God gives us opportunities to change the world. Then, later this evening, I saw <em>Kangaroo Jack</em>, with Jerry O'Connell and Anthony Anderson, and it was hillarious especially with Anthony Anderson as Louis. Now, I'm seeing for the first time, <em>License to Wed</em>, with Robin Williams, Mandy Moore, and some cast members from the tv show, <em>The Office</em>. Overall, I have seen the greatest movies and I've had a fantastic day.
