So this previous week was yet another good week of the fall 2010 semester, in which every class went well smoothly. I've submitted in my first project for data structures already and really excited about it. In addition, I've set up and managed my fantasy football team in my 'cuzinz' league entitled "The IT guy", for week 1, and already not as much points as I've deserved.<br /><br />Anyway, I've been quite an active user of digg.com nowadays and I've dugg up a video relating to what I've seen on an episode of The Office where it's based upon Pavlov's (psychologist) principle on <a href="http://www.break.com/index/classical-conditioning-on-college-roommate" target="_blank">classical conditioning</a>. And another hillarious thing I've seen just recently today was on Mindy Kaling's twitter page where it says "<a href="http://twitter.com/mindykaling/status/24100767386" target="_blank">Supervising gory blood spatters on set. It's not Dexter, it's not True Blood, it's The Office.</a>"<br /><br />Anyhow, that's all for this week and hopefully this week gets better for me. And oh yeah before I forget, I would like to introduce to all of you in regard to my recent missions trip that I've went to, here's a little video presentation that someone put together for the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3ERnMZgKp4" target="_blank">MGOCSM Wichita Missions Trip</a>
