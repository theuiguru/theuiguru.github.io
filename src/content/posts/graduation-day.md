Today marks the end of my high school chapter, I graduated from the Division Avenue High School class of 2008. First, I went to church and received Holy Qurbana. After that, went home for a while to rest and such. Then, we, my family (including two cousins of mine), went to Hofstra University's Arena where the graduation ceremony took place. It was pretty decent with all the inspirational messages said by several administrators and of course, the valedictorian and salutatorian. The valedictorian referred his speech to the video game, <em>Mario Kart</em>, which was pretty hillarious. Anyway, after graduation, went to TGIFriday's restaurant to eat lunch with the family. Overall, it was amazing and I'm sure I;m going to miss those days back in high school, and look forward towards the next chapter of my life, college. Here are some pictures to look at.<br /><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEivCsqw48cYXM_l57WEajQvv7J-p3nOyfX_-pRq4YEUcu7Adbseb-uQQQhn9k0hNYrijhhXbUo926XVtzSHRB2wuix89v_gLZ7VUAgSCxafQqlRU2QCY9q9-l-pu3upzhvyK0TL/s320/IMG_0090.JPG" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5214900155843670194"><br /><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEin-uebNnqfgK2UOtEj73SYiEM1Tj_ZhyFwcEpi6NWd_rz4s2fDOvltN-XTbyaKMEPdptKXMWK6DsLak03e7d1GZQ8sE4lgqVT73L0f_SifnNMzKBulpoPJSx4YIb3HfSYf4YLY/s320/IMG_0094.JPG" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5214900444471180754"><br /><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhVdF7_6dd0LZ6RfSByS7fqCE8WPaYG9PKwFg3z1tmYgq47ZVX42-eMZUDSbkEJdMNVYNhJUz4KyStlfUazAsGPMjXH65g9zcGZ3zZFZZgSCQR0UgcZp5OAzMn1_HDZ6mg4UctR/s320/IMG_0101.JPG" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5214900686150482850"><br /><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhAU4NQfH-I8KuIYbvzPKiXmc7umTLj0V1knlDz7bgmmBcZ4xiptdtHADOAi-J26gCZ3yGTcJ02kG_k0uGIH8MDZDae8Jf_DNNtVNrH_9TzOVWyJ9yJgsj0s8UvCKE7_2rcdJvz/s320/IMG_0097.JPG" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5214900565241897506">
