I have had a fun and blessed spring break from school. On the first Saturday, of the break (April 19), I went to my cousin's house in Syosset to celebrate my little nephew's, Jabin, second birthday, and on the following Sunday, I went to my cousin, Swithin's house to celebrate his birthday. That weekend was a blast from hanging out with the cousins and watching <em>The Office</em> funny clips. During the week, I visited NYIT and finalized everything and also, I started to begin my own website business project, which is still under development. On the following Saturday, April 26th, I went to church for the Perunal celebration of my home parish, after 23 years! Also, my parish has finally put up a curtain on the Altar, and I thought it was real nice and huge. Today, I went to my other cousin's, Rancha and Bavancha, house for the family prayer meeting. I just spoke about what I said on my previous blogpost, about drinking the wine regularly or not. Anyway, I had a fun and spectacular spring break!
