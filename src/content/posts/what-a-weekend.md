This past Saturday, I went to a friend's house, for my aunt to visit, then later went off to the airport to go see Elsyaunty, and Manipapa and Kunjuaramama off to motherland (aka Kerala, India). So, yeah I didn't spend much on Valentine's Day except for saying goodbyes to my aunt.<br /><br />Anyway, on Sunday, I didn't go to church, but did go to my cousins' house in Syosset for my uncle to teach me more about Java programming.<br /><br />Yesterday, I stayed home all day and my cousin, Alex and company, came over and stayed for a while and hung out. Later, I watched the movies <em>Accepted</em> and <em>Evan Almighty</em> again, and it was amazing to watch on how creativity works within us. Overall, this past weekend was just another ordinary fun-packed weekend!
