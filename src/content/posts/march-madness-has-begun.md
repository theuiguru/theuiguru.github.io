Today is the first round of the NCAA Tournament, and my brackets are so far so good. As of now, I pretty much have all the number ones, from each region, in the final four (Louisville, UCONN, Pittsburgh, and UNC). I have UNC and UCONN in the National Championship, in result to UNC winning the title. Also, I recently saw a video of our President Barack Obama's bracket, in which he also thinks that UNC is going to take the title.
