I recently found this video from one of my cousins. It's involved with all the celebrities first talking about not voting, then suddenly tells everyone to vote if people think that there really needs to be a change.<br /><center><object width="370" height="320"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/VhDRVKDcXQo&hl=en&fs=1&color1=0x3a3a3a&color2=0x999999&border=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/VhDRVKDcXQo&hl=en&fs=1&color1=0x3a3a3a&color2=0x999999&border=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" width="370" height="320"></embed></object></center>I also found this cool informative election site from Google, <a href="http://www.google.com/2008election" target="_blank">www.google.com/2008election</a>, check it out!
