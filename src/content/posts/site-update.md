I finally got a twitter and other social media accounts! So feel free to follow me on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/cthomas1211">twitter</a> or anything else, on the right sidebar of my blog, in order to get updates on various events and activities that I have going on in my life.<br /><br />Anyway, nothing else is much new besides the fact that I went to NJ for the weekend for my cousin's engagement ceremony, so overall that was fun and made my weekend. Can't wait for Thanksgiving with the family this week...Gobble Gobble folks! <br /><br />Also, be sure to check out this infographic link that I digged up from a friend on facebook entitled <a href="http://sixrevisions.com/infographs/web-designers-vs-web-developers" target="_blank">Web Designers vs. Web Developers</a>, and I think I'm more of a web designer than a web programmer, got to really upgrade my skillset in order to get a decent job.
