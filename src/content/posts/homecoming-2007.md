I had a blast at the Pep Rally and Homecoming. I was nominated for Homecoming King. On Saturday, I was in a convertible going through the parade, ate some excellent food like, Outback Steakhouse, and watched the football game against Great Neck South High School. Our team was losing at first like 28-7, then all of a sudden we came back by <em><strong>one</strong></em> point, 29-28. That was a sick game! I really enjoyed this fun event. As a bonus, I added some homecoming pictures. Pictures are available online, as well!
