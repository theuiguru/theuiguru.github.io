As of now of what's going on within the NBA playoffs of 2009, I've been following Yahoo Sports on this a bit. It's tough to say because all the teams in the playoffs are really good, considering that I want the same two teams who both entered the finals in 2006, and Miami won. Anyway, here's how I think it goes for the first round in the playoffs:<br /><br /><strong>Conference Quarter-Finals</strong><br /><em><strong>East:</strong></em> Cleveland Cavaliers, Boston Celtics, Philadelphia 76ers, and Miami Heat<br /><em><strong>West:</strong></em> LA Lakers, Denver Nuggets, Dallas Mavericks, and Houston Rockets
