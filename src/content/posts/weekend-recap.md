This past weekend, my sister and I were home alone, while my parents were away in Jersey for a funeral. My sister's friends came over to just hang out and watch movies in the living room, while I was upstairs just doing the usual browsing and what not. Anyway, ordered pizza and ate. Parents came home around 7.<br /><br />Today, stayed home again and watched Selection Sunday on CBSSports, so have to print out my bracket by this week. I'm excited that Binghamton's in the bracket this year, along with the number 1 seed; UNC, and Tennessee.  Anyway, had fun this weekend and now watching <em>Hitch</em>, again!
