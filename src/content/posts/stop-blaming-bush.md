Here's an interesting political cartoon I found on Digg.com entitled, "<i><a href="http://img.timeinc.net/time/cartoons/20090123/cartoons_04.jpg" target="_blank">Well At Least I Got One Thing Done!!</a></i>", about former president George W. Bush. Since I am moderately conservative, in my opinion, I think that Bush was a decent president with a lot of intelligence and faith, and he did all he could to help this nation in times of trouble. It was his administration that led him to make wrong decisions for the nation.
