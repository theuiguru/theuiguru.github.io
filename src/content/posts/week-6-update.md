Week 6 has been another pretty dull, yet hectic week for me, considering that I've been studying in school last week (especially for programming class). Along with that, this past Thursday, I've attended a decent discussion of the men's ministry group. On Friday, didn't do anything except do the usual again like watch my favorite shows on hulu and what not. Didn't do much throughout the weekend either except, went to Syosset for my family prayer meeting. So, anyway that's about it for the week recap!
