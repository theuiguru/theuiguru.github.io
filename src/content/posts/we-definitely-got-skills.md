I was listening to my home parish boys song (<em>God Show Me The Way</em>), from the NYLC08 MP3 Music Contest, and it kind of sounds like a video game in the beginning. The St. Stephen's boys got some talent. Anyway, you can hear it now by <a href="http://www.nylc08.com/content/view/62/73/" target="_blank">clicking here</a> (Song is on the bottom of the page).
