This is the month of March and people are already going crazy for NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament and setting up brackets. I, however, am rooting for either North Carolina or Tennessee. I don't really care, I just like watching it for for, though. As well, this is the Great & Holy Lenten season, which certain people fast for fifty (50) days until Easter or the Resurrection of our Lord. I fasted junk food and no meat on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. My family from Philly on my dad's and mom's side came over because of my beloved ammachi's forty-first day. Other than that, I pray everyday hoping that I could succeed in my life, and I also can get excited once in a while.
