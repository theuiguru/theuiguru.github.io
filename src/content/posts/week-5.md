This past Thursday, I attended my on-campus fellowship on the topic of: "How <u>Real</u> is God?" On Thursday night, actually watched The Office wedding episode, of Pam and Jim, which was pretty good considering that I added one of the songs to my itunes list (Chris Brown Forever song).<br /><br />Friday through Saturday, didn't do much either except stay at home, do the usual, and plus watch continuously that wedding episode forever scene. Today, drove to church today and after that, went home and relaxed a bit too much (forgot that tonight there was a praise night at LIMC). Anyway, overall, I had another moderate week, hopefully things will change considering that I'm off tomorrow from classes.
