I have five regents this year with U.S. History, Math B, Chemistry, Spanish, and English. I love U.S. History, Math, and Chemistry. I get awesome grades in those classes. My US History teacher is awesome and knows how to help me in problems I don't seem to understand. Anyway, only one and half months left 'till school is over. Then, it' s probably part-time jobs and searching for colleges.<br />Oh yeah, I cannot believe that the Phoenix Suns lost in the West Conf. Semi-Finals. I guess it's going to be a worse team this year or maybe it's going to be Detroit and San Antonio in the finals again.
