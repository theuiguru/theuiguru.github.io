So anyway the week has been going fine and the usual goes on everyday. Throughout the weekend, went to my cousin, Sherry's house for math tutoring. Then after that, went directly to church for a youth faith study series on the Holy Qurbana, led by a third-year seminarian, Diju Skariah from St. Gregorios, Bellwood (Chicago). <br /><br />Today, went to church, rested at home for a bit, and watched a little coverage of NCAA March Madness tournament. Actually been kind of surprised at Cornell and Tennessee going further into the <em>Sweet 16</em> round of the tournament. I also happened to love someone's facebook status saying "it be a great Office episode, if cornell won! GO NARDDOG!", or otherwise known as Andy Bernard (fictional character from Cornell played by Ed Helms). Overall, had a pretty decent week. On an additional note, I also watched the movie <em>300</em> just recently tonight on tbs, which I think happened to give a deep philosophy on Greek culture.
