This past week was tiresome for me, because I was tired on Monday from all the traveling being done from the Virginia reunion trip. Also, since it's already December, I was thinking of how this year went by so fast, and now it's like everyone's in the Christmas mood this season. It actually snowed yesterday, and I happened to watch <em>The Office</em>'s Christmas episodes. Also yesterday, I attended the St. John's MTC praise night of worship, which was pretty fun discussing the theme on how to become holy. Today, went to church, then relaxed at home, and now watching tv and doing some schoolwork.
