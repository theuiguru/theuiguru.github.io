It's finally here and I have to do homework that I need to complete. I have searched some majors and minors in mind, even though I still have some more time. I was thinking of maybe information systems, computer science, finance, and political science. I'm going to see the Penn State campus this week with my family. Also, I have one of my cousins here who came from India on a business trip. We all were talking, yesterday, about the usual college talk (Colleges, majors, finance, etc.) for me.
