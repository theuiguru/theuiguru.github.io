This past week was with the usual school and work, and I actually got an A on a midterm, so that made my week. Anyway, yesterday got the chance to watch Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace, which was quite cool to watch, along with almost finished with all the current seasons of the hillarious show, The Big Bang Theory. Today, went to church and celebrated Dinah's graduation. Then later, went to the usual Brush Hollow theatres to watch Toy Story 3 with the family. The movie was absolutely great. After the movie, went to Swithin's house for an annual fourth of July family barbeque. So overall, I had a pretty fantastic week watching movies and shows, and hanging out with my wonderful, blessed family.<br /><br />Again, I often browse through the web everyday to find something new for me to post about, and here's what I found, in which it is a <a href="http://twitter.com/kevinrose/status/17615326246" target="_blank">tweet that I saw on Kevin Rose's (Digg founder) twitter page to a video link of Jack Dorsey's (Twitter Co-Founder) tech talk at Digg</a>, probably a must-see video for all developers!
