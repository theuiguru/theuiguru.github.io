This past week, I started classes at NYIT, last Tuesday, and classes are good so far. Anyway, yesterday, went out to dinner with the cousins for my cousin, Alex's upcoming year in college and all, at TGIFriday's restaurant in Westbury. Today, went to church, had our church's car wash after service, went home and watched a couple of NFL games (today marking start of week 1), like the Jets/Houston and Giants/Redskins. So, I'm ready for another great season of NFL and fantasy football, which reminds me to look up some football terms and rules on wikipedia. Anyway, overall it was another amazing weekly turnout
