So this past week was quite interesting with school, work, and of course browsing the web in order to improve my programming skills. I actually found three helpful links regarding HTML5 and CSS3. One of them is entitled <a href="http://css3please.com" target="_blank">CSS3Please.com</a>, which is pretty much a playground site for css developers. Another one is an html5 article from the well-renowned Yahoo developer, Nicholas C. Zakas's website labeled <a href="http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2008/02/28/thoughts-on-html-5/" target="_blank">Thoughts on HTML 5</a>, and finally the third link is called <a href="http://ajaxian.com" target="_blank">Ajaxian</a> about various web development topics. I've been also falling in love with one of Apple's newest products, the iPad, in which it is great for web developers like myself, and considering that all techies have one. Other than that, I've had a pretty awesome and tiresome week so far, hopefully things will turn out better this week.<br /><object width="400" height="300"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/1-YAQ1wfNqc&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1?color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999&amp;hd=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/1-YAQ1wfNqc&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1?color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999&amp;hd=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="400" height="300"></embed></object>
