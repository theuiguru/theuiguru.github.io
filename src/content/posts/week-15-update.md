This past week was a hectic week for me considering that I had my finals to study for. On Monday, was my last day of class of the semester. Starting on Thursday all the way through Friday were three finals, which went well. After my final on Friday, got a chance to go to Catiague Park in Hicksville, to watch the official IND probate of the NYIT Gamma class, which was pretty insane to watch, and also it was cold outside. After the probate, went to Broadway mall and hung out and chill with some of the brothers, at the food court, which was pretty sweet.<br /><br />Yesterday, it started snowing pretty heavily and badly. While it snowed, just watched some holiday movies on tv. Today, didn't go to church because of the storm that occurred last night. So, relaxed a bit, watched some movies, and studying for my lit final for tomorrow. Anyway, I have to get ready for the Christmas season, this Friday, to spend a decent time with my loving family.
