This past week was yet another amazing week! I actually got the chance to go to the Intervarsity: Men's Ministry on campus, on Thursday. Also, I saw The Office, which was not that good that night. On Friday, spent the time watching the rest of the nbc (and other sitcoms) shows on hulu. Today, went to church, went to dunkin' donuts on the way home, relaxed a bit, and did my homework. Along with that, kept track of my fantasy football team for week 4, in which I did really well (109-62), and went out to dinner to the same Thai restaurant (back in 2008) with the cousins to celebrate Sherry's birthday, and met some of her church friends too. <br />So, week 4 was pretty sweet!
