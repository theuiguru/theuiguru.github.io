So today is the end of the Great and Holy fast of 2014, or otherwise known as Easter. Had all types of emotion run through me today during and after church, wondering what to eat today rather than focus on the mental aspects of it. Seriously, I felt like dancing to all the hymns today at church (I was that excited). You don't know how I look forward to this day every year, besides Christmas of course. It's true what the infamous Tenny Thomas achen was saying about Easter being the "festival of festivals" and how we put on our BEST clothes, and yes I LITERALLY spent the day before, shopping for new clothing items and accessories. It's practically my second Christmas.<br />
<br />
But all in all, this lent has taught me a lot. I feel like every year it's the same for me in terms of having similar problems faced during lent. If you know me, some people describe me as the Incredible Hulk. I can struggle with anger, a lot. Especially with having temp jobs to looking for a full-time one, or even just applying to grad school programs in computer science. I am often angry because I want people to be satisfied with their needs first ahead than my own. When I went to my first confession back in 2011 at Baltimore Leadership Camp, Leeson achen made me realize that I strive for perfection a lot (as a typical Indian-malayalee would). I mean I know there's a whole bunch out there since the Internet is a HUGE place to go to for tutorials and such on anger management. But in my mind, being the Internet the way it is with advertising, I think that there's no way to really control it. I guess since then, or at least since college started, I have been often quiet a lot mainly because I will always try to hold it in from saying something lame. Then again, this lent has made me make confident decisions in wanting something urgently (of course not love yet).<br />
<br />
Happy Easter to all, and to all a good night.</div>
