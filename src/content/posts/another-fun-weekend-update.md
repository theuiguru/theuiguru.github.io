This past Friday was my sister's 17th birthday, spent the day at TGIFriday's restaurant for lunch. Then later, drove with my sister, Dinah, and Priya to the Roosevelt Field mall and browsed around many stores, including Apple and this new store called "Dylan's Candy Bar". Anyway, went back home around seven, and ate a snow cone.<br /><br />On Saturday, my parents went to Philly for the entire day and night, while Dinah and I stayed home alone. Then on Sunday, didn't go to church, but parents came back from Philly. Later on throughout the day, went to Syosset for our annual onam party, which we had a pretty decent dinner, but not that many people arrived like last time. Oh yeah while there, I also saw this horror movie called "Prom Night", with some of the cousins.
