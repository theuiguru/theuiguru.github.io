This past Friday, was the beginning of the new year of 2010, which my family and I saw the ball drop at midnight on tv. Then later that night, we actually had a get-together dinner at our house, which was fun indeed for me. The next day, Saturday, didn't do much until that night, went bowling with four of my other cousins. I actually placed first in the end of the game.<br /><br />Then on Sunday, went to church, and after church, went to the airport to pick up one of my aunts who flew in from Nashville. Also, got the chance to go over to my friend, Tom's house, in which I actually played, as a first-timer, water pong (the virgin-version of beer pong). After that, went to TGIFriday's restaurant with my family and aunt, and then went home. Overall, it started off as a great new year, especially spending time with family and friends.
