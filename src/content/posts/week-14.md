This past week was pretty good for me, considering that on Friday was my 20th birthday. So, on Thursday, went to the last Christian fellowship meeting of the semester, and then later that night, watched all of the NBC shows which were airing the Christmas episodes, pretty hillarous when you watch it. On Friday (my birthday), didn't have much plans except for dinner. Today, went to church, and now I'm browsing tv/online, paper writing, and studying for my finals for this week. Overall, had a decent weekly turnout. Man, I was thinking to myself how this year, 2009, went by so fast!
