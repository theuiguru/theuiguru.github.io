This past week and weekend update was pretty much posted up on my Ponnasseril family website, where I got the chance to see the city a lot more with my fellow 'cuzinz'.<br /><br />Now, this week I'm actually observing Holy & Passion Week, coming to an end to this Great Lent. So anyway, I've been browsing around the web as usual and trying to find out what direction I'm going to go with this blog. I actually found this youtube video regarding the old pbskids show 'ZOOM', which I kind of missed nowadays and their 'ubbi-dubbi' language, especially Pablo and his amazing skills.<br /><br /><object width="400" height="300"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/0Q9v3tZ5IC4&hl=en_US&fs=1&color1=0x3a3a3a&color2=0x999999"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/0Q9v3tZ5IC4&hl=en_US&fs=1&color1=0x3a3a3a&color2=0x999999" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="400" height="300"></embed></object>
