So I know I haven't posted anything in quite a while on this blog, but had a really interesting previous week down in Wichita, Kansas where I was working with six other people, including Mat achen, on a MGOCSM missions trip held annually. Besides the heat and humidity throughout the whole week, I guess what I can say regarding the whole trip was that it was truly a remarkable experience to go through, in which we all helped build and paint homes for <i>Habitat for Humanity</i>, spoke to some wonderful sisters at the convent where we stayed for the entire week, plus took a tour to see a future monastery in place and an Antiochan Orthodox church with such sacred icons of the Orthodox church. Generally overall, it was truly an amazing and blessed experience working to change the world by making "one Act of Random Kindness [ARK] at a time" (Quote from Morgan Freeman in <i>Evan Almighty</i>).<br /><br />After arriving back home in New York yesterday afternoon, was extremely exhausted throughout the rest of the weekend, and had a family barbeque at our home last night.
