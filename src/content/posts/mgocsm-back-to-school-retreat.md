Today, I went to St. Gregorios Church in Elmont, where we had our area back-to-school retreat. The guest speaker was the very own, Rev. Dn. Gregory Varghese, talking about preparing for the new academic year spiritually. One of the verses in which he referred to was St. Luke 12:48 and the temptations we go through everyday that distracts us from our way towards our goals. Greg semessan also mentioned the core values in our life, which are: family, work, and spiritual life. As well as, he discussed about the meaning of one of the qurbana's hymns, "<em>Blessed are those servants good...</em>", and how it all relates to our relationship with God. After that, we went into two small groups and discussed about different issues with school and church. Overall, it was an amazing and influential retreat.
