I actually had fun this past weekend. I had my SAT II: Mathematics Level 1 test in the morning. Then, I went to Syosset to go see my cousins, who flew here from Denver. After that, we, cousins, went directly to my other cousins' church, St. John's Mar Thoma Church in Queens Village, for their praise and worship night. It was fun and met some old friends from previous VBS years. We then rode off to the diner, ate, and spent some family quality time.
