Anyway this past week was yet another week going through school and doing the usual at home. However, I was home alone all weekend while family went to New Jersey and Philadelphia for my sister's college open house tours, and of course visiting family there as well. So, spent the entire weekend watching movies on tbs, and catching up on the golf Masters' Tournament, in which Phil Mickelson won his third title this year, and Tiger and KJ Choi eventually came in a tie at fourth place. I also actually spent the night at Sherry and Shanu's house, and met with my cousins there who happened to visit from Bangalore, India for Ranjit's wedding that's eventually coming up this Saturday, can't wait for that though! Generally, I had a pretty decent week.<br /><br />As well as that, I came across a <a href="http://twitter.com/SWitHBeAtZ/status/11674793769" target="_blank">recent tweet</a> on my cousin's twitter page this past week that brought to my mind a lot about Apple's new product, the iPad, and I totally agree with him on this one. And also, I've been reading some comic strips off of the yahoo news site, particularly Dilbert and Garfield, and was quite interested in this specific one from <a href="http://d.yimg.com/a/p/umedia/20100401/largeimage.60be8043d006ce2df867654e95ba127e.gif">Dilbert regarding website design</a> posted up last two weeks.
