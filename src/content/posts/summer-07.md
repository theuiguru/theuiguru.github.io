Summer is here and I am really pumped up for lots of fun activities. I volunteered at my area OVBS for two days. Then, on Saturday, I went to Six Flags with all my cousins. We stopped at Justin and Alex's house to meet up, then we went to Brooklyn to pick up Ranjit and Roshan. All of them went on all the rides, <em>Nitro, Kingda Ka, Batman, Medusa, El Toro, etc.</em> I went on the <em>SpongeBob SquarePants the 3d Ride, the Great American Race</em> where I rode cars along with my older cousin, Ranjit, and I finally got on a ride, <em>Rolling Thunder</em> with the help of my other two older cousins. After that, we then rode off home, along with eating at a local service station. For a bonus, here is a picture of all of us, cousins, at Six Flags<br><div align="center"><img src="http://widget.slide.com/rdr/1/1/2/S/900000002025a48/1/58/_Svm9vVn7T_AYJYhfefxYicBSSD9Wgi5.jpg" border="0" alt="CUZINZ at Six Flags"></div>
