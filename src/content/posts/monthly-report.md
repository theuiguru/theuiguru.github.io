So I've been kind of dull these past few weeks in updating or trying to take what direction for this blog. But don't worry (for those of you reading this), hopefully I'll get my very own twitter account someday or even some exciting events pop up.<br /><br />Anyway, had a decent previous week of accomplishing short-term goals in which I got an A on my data structures midterm, plus tried out some new restaurants like Five Guys; Burger and Fries, and Panera Bread, also of course watching <i>The Social Network</i> movie on Saturday night, which was a pretty decent movie for me (expected more in the end, but two hours was long enough...lol), and in addition to that, watching new episodes of my favorite tv shows.
