So this past week was my first week as an intern at my local hospital's IT department, in which I, along with another intern, had to mainly dismantle and enable hardware systems together, which was pretty cool for me to learn more about the processor. Anyway, yesterday was my sister's graduation from high school, in which most of the cousins showed up, and then lunch afterwards. Today, went to church, relaxed at home, while Justin and Alex came over as well. I also had the chance to watch "The Big Bang Theory" about nerds and a cute girl, which is absolutely hillarious. So that's about it for this past week which was enjoyable for me to hang out with family, meet some new people, and have some more computer hardware knowledge.
