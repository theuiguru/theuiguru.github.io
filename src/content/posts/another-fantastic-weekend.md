It has been quite a while since my latest post. Anyway, this past Friday, went to the mall, browsed, and ate at the food court. Then, later, went over to a friend's house to chill with some friends. Yesterday, went to church for an MGOCSM Bible Study, led by Daniel chemachen, about relationships.<br /><br />Today, not to mention that today was Father's Day (HAPPY FATHER'S DAY!), woke up at 5AM in the morning, because it was our family's turn to be the church early birds. After that, went home and relaxed a bit, and went to Justin and Alex's house for our usual family prayer meeting, in which it was quite organized the fact that Justin and everybody else led us into a discussion between science and religion. Overall, this was another fantastic and amazing weekend.
