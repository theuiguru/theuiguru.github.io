Yesterday, went to church and celebrated the Holy Qurbana, went straight to the hotel to take some rest, and then went home and cleaned everything up.<br /><br />Anyway, after that, went straight to Syosset for the family Easter party. I had fun with my cousins coming in from Colorado. It's sweet and awesome of my little baby nephew, Jabin, talking at the age of two (becoming three this week). During the party, we prayed, ate, chit-chatted, and watched tv. Overall, it was fun for me.
