It's that time of year again, where it gets colder and midterms are fast approaching. By the way, today was daylight savings, pushing the clock back an hour. Anyway, this past week was pretty hectic for me considering that I've had exams and other classes to study for. Yesterday was Halloweeeen, didn't do much. So, overall it was just a boring and hectic week for me, except played around browsing youtube videos.
