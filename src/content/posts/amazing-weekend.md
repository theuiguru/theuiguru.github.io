This past weekend, my dad and I went down to New Jersey to go visit family. At first, we went to my second cousin's child's birthday party and chit-chatted a bit with some of my cousins. Then, went off to go see other family members who lived in the area because my aunt (from India) wanted to visit them. That night, I stayed at my cousin, Anita's house, while my dad and aunt stayed with family in Jersey.<br /><br />Today, woke up (nice of waking up normally rather by waking up early for my church), and got ready to go to my cousin's church, St. Gregorios, Philadelphia. The church looked beautiful, except for the altars since it was still under construction. Also, I got to have the chance to participate and take Holy Qurbana from the new church. After service, while I ate lunch at church, I got to meet some family and friends. After church, went off to Anita's house for me to pack my stuff and then we three, me, dad, and aunty, rode off home to New York. Overall, I've had an amazing experience traveling here and there, and seeing some family and friends.<br /><br />Also, here is an interesting comic strip I found on digg, earlier, and it's very true considering I'm a computer science major and felt the same way, as the guy who always have questions, when I learned about computer architecture.<br /><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgvP4hGgyIQVFupozlgb7NQklqQQyM8lRfPWyw9SlVUJ-GReeHDvm98EcZz77f85h9ojXkuiGQCvmAUukvuYTbQG_jTk2ph202pnV2vXDHPEqZ4sYnUkiwK0cMys8HQBuoLVg-6/s1600-h/cp101.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 244px;" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgvP4hGgyIQVFupozlgb7NQklqQQyM8lRfPWyw9SlVUJ-GReeHDvm98EcZz77f85h9ojXkuiGQCvmAUukvuYTbQG_jTk2ph202pnV2vXDHPEqZ4sYnUkiwK0cMys8HQBuoLVg-6/s320/cp101.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5287669738656712386" /></a>
