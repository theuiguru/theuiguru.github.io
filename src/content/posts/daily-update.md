Yesterday, I watched online two episodes of NBC's "The Office" and today I recently watched a series premiere of "Parks and Recreation". I actually think that the shows are getting a little better nowadays with the plot and script.<br /><br />I actually found a really cool link of the <a href="http://www.michaelscottpapercompany.com" target="_blank">Michael Scott Paper Company</a> website, that they say Michael Scott (played by Steve Carell) happened to design.
