This past week was the first week of the new year, 2010. After the whole Christmas/New Year's celebrations at different houses, things felt kind of bored nowadays. On the other hand, I actually got a part-time job working at a small pool company in Westbury as a web designer, with a decent wage, in which I found it on craigslist. Anyway, the job started out good and still progressing. Yesterday and today, didn't do much either except watch movies on tv, went to church, and watching a little bit of football, especially when the Jets won last night. So, overall, the year went off to a good start for week one. Hopefully, more exciting and fun stuff will be arriving in the coming months.<br /><br />Also, I know I haven't been actively sending out videos through this blog, but this past week, I actually was browsing around and found a lot of information regarding Twitter and its creator, Jack Dorsey. So, here is a youtube video I found from diggnation about Dorsey's latest project called Square.<br /><br /><object width="400" height="300"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/v/Ib_PnEI2hAw&hl=en_US&fs=1&color1=0x3a3a3a&color2=0x999999"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/v/Ib_PnEI2hAw&hl=en_US&fs=1&color1=0x3a3a3a&color2=0x999999" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="400" height="300"></embed></object>
