On Saturday, my home parish MGOCSM had a bible study about the Holy Qurbana, just the introduction to it, through powerpoint. The presentation was mainly about how it is connected to our Lord's Last Supper and how we all should be prepared for this sacrament. After that, we surprised Daniel chemachen by giving him a custom-made frame along with Italian food and cake. The guys were playing basketball, while the rest of us were chit-chatting. Overall, I had a fun and great weekend.
