The New York Giants won by 17-14 against the New England Patriots, in the last minute of the game. For a second there, I thought to myself that the Patriots were going to take it all by 14-10. But, I had the faith in God that the Giants were going to win this one, and it was coming home to New York!<br /><em>It is so good to be a New Yorker...= )!</em><br /><strong><font color="#0000FF">BIG BLUE - SUPER BOWL CHAMPS OF 2008!</font></strong>
