I had a pretty good week with work, school, and whatever else was going on with my life this past week. I actually had fun learning some new stuff regarding installing computers, in addition to getting my first paycheck as a technology intern. Anyway yesterday, had family over, then went to my cousin, Priya's house for her graduation party and spent a while there. Today, went to St. Gregorios church in Elmont, where my cousin, Anita, my sister, and myself attended the service at their newly consecrated church. Also, talked to some new faces, as well as old too. So that's pretty much what happened this week.<br /><br />Furthermore, I actually was browsing through various search engines about the new HTML version 5.0, and so far I found an awesome and helpful link entitled <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com" target="_blank">HTML5Rocks.com</a>.
