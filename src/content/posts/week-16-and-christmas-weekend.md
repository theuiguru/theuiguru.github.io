This past week, I finished up all my college finals, which went pretty well. On Friday was Christmas Day, went to church for Christmas service in the morning. Also, a bit later after church, went to Syosset for our family's Christmas party, which was pretty fun considering that Jabin and family, from Colorado, came to spend their time with us.<br /><br />Anyway, the next day, Saturday, we again went to Syosset at night, to spend some more quality time with just the cousins, with food, games, and watching tv/movies. I actually got the chance to watch "Paul Blart: Mall Cop", which was another awesome movie for me. On Sunday, felt kinda sick and stayed in bed all day and night. So, overall, I guess you can say I've had a decent time with my family, now time for me to get a job over this winter break.
