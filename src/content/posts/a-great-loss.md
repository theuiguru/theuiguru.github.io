Today, I went to church, then off to a prayer at Tijo and Tobin's house, finally went to Tobin Varughese's house to watch the Giants/Eagles game on fox. When I arrived, met some old and new friends, and ate popcorn and drink soda. The first half looked good with the Giants defense, then later on, the Giants lost to the Eagles with a score of 23-11. After that, the guys played a new game introduced called Black Magic, game played with my cousins at Christmas party in 2007, and some played Texas Hold 'Em Poker. I went upstairs and watched tv. Overall, I had an amazing day, but very disappointed with the fact that New York lost against Philly.
