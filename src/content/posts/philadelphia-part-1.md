This past Friday, I went to Philly with my dad in the afternoon to go see and move everything to my cousins' (from India) new apartment, located in 1865 Welsh Rd. While there, went to Wal-Mart to buy a bunch of material for their new home. After that, went to Jacob and Nathan's house to eat dinner. After dinner, went to Anita's house to sleep over.<br /><br />On Saturday, I spent the morning and afternoon home alone at Anita's house, while everyone else was shopping, which was pretty cool for me to explore their home. Anyway, we moved the furniture into their new homes, and ate chinese food for dinner. Later, Jacob and Nancy came along and got to hang out with me and the other cousins. Then, went to Anita's house again to sleep over. <br /><br />Yesterday, I did not happen to go to church, instead I went over to their apartments and we had an achen come over and prayed for their new homes. After that, ate pizza for lunch. After that, me and my dad went off back home in NY, which eventually led to traffic and a heavy storm. Overall, it was an amazing Philly weekend experience.
