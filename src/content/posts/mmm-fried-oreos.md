Today, I tried out the most famous Street Theologian's (aka Steven Kurian) deep fried oreos. With the help from my mom, I made them and they were actually good and delicious. Check out this link <a href="http://www.street-theologian.com/2008/08/deep-fried-oreosorthodox-style.html" target="_blank"><em>Deep Fried Oreos...Orthodox Style!</em></a> from the Street Theologian on how to make it. Here is a picture of my version of fried oreos.<br /><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhqULt8Vv3YfoCrJ7Al45iwov6LQ38lFQfZiLZb6IbtxI7SWQEYKi9SmG_G3kpYEn96F7gtZJ8fbqWbOUMgAwOppoLJ6AMnXk_L9t81QQhwu79maV64q379F7zW2yMBU8UtkmuQ/s320/IMG_0566.JPG" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5239358956876004162">
