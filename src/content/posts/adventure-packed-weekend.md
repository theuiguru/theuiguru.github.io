Yesterday, on July 12, I went to Bushkill Falls, in the Poconos (also known as <em>The Niagara of Pennsylvania</em>), along with my cousins on a road trip. We were stuck in traffic for about thirty minutes, some cousins of mine blamed me because of my lateness. Anyway, when we got there, we first grabbed lunch, and I ate a chicken tenders meal, with fries and a Mountain Dew. After that, we went on our hiking trail and it was absolutely beautiful seeing nature and the falls flowing. It kind of made me reminisce about the time when I went on that trip to St. Tikhon's Seminary. So, anyway, most of us were a little tired about going up and down the stairs, of the mountain. After the hike, we then relaxed a bit, and then rode off home, back to New York. Also, we stopped at an outlet store on the way, Odd-A-Lot, in which one of my cousins bought fireworks to use for himself. So, we decided to grab some dinner at this Thai restaurant called <em>Jaiya</em>. Overall, it was a fun adventure and a great experience for me.
