This past week was a pretty awesome and fun week considering that I ended my summer classes on Wednesday. Plus, played a new hillarious questionaire game at work in which it was a parody of me asking too many questions, and watched many, new, and exciting movies such as <i>Up, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, Date Night, and Star Trek</i>. In addition to that, yesterday I got the time to hang out with my awesome fun-loving family at Swithin's house to meet his new mate, Rena, and her family. Generally speaking this week went absolutely well and amazing.<br /><br />So anyway, I found out a movie trailer link that's coming out on October 1st regarding about how Facebook was created, entitled <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53OUHupfqws" target="_blank">The Social Network</a>, in which I found out yesterday from my cousins, and some said this movie is probably going to be dull.
