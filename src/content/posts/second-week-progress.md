Hey all! This past week was absolutely amazing for me considering that I got accepted as a transfer computer science student at the SUNY College at Old Westbury, still figuring out the details this week though. Also, got paid from my part-time job as a web-designer. On Friday, saw Avatar in 3d at the Levittown theaters, with my sister, and the movie was absolutely amazing as the critics said it was, especially with awesome effects and graphics.<br /><br />Anyway, today went to church, especially today was my ammachi's three year memorial anniversary (miss you always). After church, went to McDonald's to grab breakfast with the family, and then went straight home and got ready for our usual family prayer meeting, which was held at our house. So anyway, before the prayer started, watched the Jets/Chargers game with the cousins, amazing JETS won that game and go further into the playoffs next week. After the prayer, watched my favorite character on Parks and Recreation, Aziz Ansari's (aka Tom Havorford in the show) comedy show, along with Russell Peters. So anyway overall, had a fantastic and sweeet week!<br /><br />Oh yeah also, I've been very fond of twitter nowadays, especially the fact about their site's history, design, and people's tweets, I think I might get one this week, not sure though!
