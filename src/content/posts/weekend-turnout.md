This past weekend went to church to drop off my sister and friend at church for choir practice, then off to my cousin's house to drop off a calculator, in which I stayed a bit later to chill and eat. After choir practice, went straight to a friend's house to eat dinner, then finally home.<br /><br />Today, I actually went to church, in which it was English Qurbana and a Mammen achen (Southern Region), chemachens, and seminarians were there. After church, went home and relaxed a bit. Then, drove to another friend's house to watch the Houston/Lakers game, then played basketball a bit (guys taught me some drills), ate some food, and watched the Celtics/Magic game later throughout the night. Anyway, overall it was yet another weekend experience hanging out with my church brothers.
