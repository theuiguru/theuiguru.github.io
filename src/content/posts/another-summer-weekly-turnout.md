This past week was just another week of internship and school, so didn't do much except hearing on Fox News that Lebron James moving part to the Miami Heat now. Yesterday, got a chance to go to Swithin's house for his church prayer meeting, then later, in his house, watched a movie called "Kick Ass", which was alright and rated R. So today, didn't a get a chance to go to church, but my sister and Anita from Philly went though. A while later, her brother and wife, Anish-chach and Debbie-chechi, came along from Queens and spent some time at our house for the first time. I just relaxed, ate, and hung out with some cousins who came along, during the night from a youth barbeque. Overall, it was a pretty good week. By the way yesterday, my cousins and I also happened to watch a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsOOq215Ew" target="_blank">youtube video trailer regarding the new movie, Mortal Kombat</a>, which is probably another gruesome movie to watch someday when it comes out.
