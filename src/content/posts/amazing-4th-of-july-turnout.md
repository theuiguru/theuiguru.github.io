Yesterday was the fourth of July, and I pretty much spent the day at the park playing basketball, with my little cousins. Then later, I went to the movies at Brush Hollow to watch <em>Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen</em>. The movie was great and hillarious, especially with all the high-tech stuff going on. <br /><br />After that, went food shopping with Sherry, Shanu, and Dinah to Key Food, in Queens, for the barbeque cook-out at Bavan(chachan)'s house. At the barbeque, we all ate, chit-chatted a bit, and met some friends from their church, until Shanu decided to launch a firework behind Bavan(chachan)'s house. So, later, we all cleaned up, went inside and ate some delicious apple pie, that we bought. After that, went outside and launched more of Shanu's fireworks. It was fun and cool to see all the amazing fireworks' designs and all. Overall, it was an amazing experience this year!
