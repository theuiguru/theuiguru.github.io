I made a few resolutions this year. They are as follows:<br /><strong>1. DO NOT FORGET THREE THINGS: OBEY ~ WORK HARD ~ PRAY</strong><br />2. Time Management<br />3. Be Patient!<br /><br />I also had a GREAT time at the MGOCSM Christmas/New Year's show in Philly, yesterday. Met some great friends and bought an Orthodoxy t-shirt at the NYLC booth during intermission of the show..= )!
