Today was actually a great and fantastic day because of several reasons. First, I received an A on an economics test, and participated in every class (including communication and political science).<br /><br />During the usual free hour period, went off to the CCF (Calvary Christian Fellowship) meeting where we ate, watched a video clip, and discussed about discipleship (notice I wrote about this on my blog earlier).<br /><br />Later, in my poli sci class, the professor discussed about Congress(one of my favorite topics in American Politics). A while later, the professor went off topic a bit discussing about America's national pastime, baseball, in which he was a big fan of the Yankees and talked about many different players' perspectives. Anyway, I've had a great day today, just wished everyday could be like this (LOL), not to mention that today's my mom's birthday!
