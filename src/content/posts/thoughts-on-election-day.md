It has certainly been a while since I left an imprint on this blog. Been meaning to know which direction to take, but knowing me there's no direction.<br />
<br />
Anyway, in regard to this whole election day, been thinking about who to vote for, especially in times like the economic crisis, healthcare issues, and all of that political "mumbo-jumbo". However, been wondering why the heck people, especially the young-ins, do support Barack Obama for President. I mean honestly, Why?!? Because he caught someone that we were tracking for since September 11th, or even reasons being that he's African-American. Let's not forget the fact that he publicly stated his support for the gay rights community. It just sickens me that politics is as usual, and people vote for him primarily because he's black, seriously?!?<br />
<br />
I was watching the season two premiere of the ABC sitcom: Last Man Standing (the show with Tim Allen), last week, and it talked about the political-economical facts that this nation is currently facing. I've actually&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/cthomas1211/status/264745369580236800">tweeted</a>&nbsp;this out in which Tim Allen responds within the show: "Obama is looking out for working people. He's gotta look out for them 'cause they're nowhere to be found." which is amusing, yet very true. Plus, citing the fact that Obama caught Osama Bin Laden, in which he didn't but some navy seals did. If someone says that fact one more time, I swear I'm gonna pull the "But what about Bush?" comment, because to be fair, under Bush's leadership, we caught Saddam Hussein and built a homeland security system (Yes-sirree, he did do something effective throughout the nation in which he got re-elected for a second term!)<br />
<br />
You see (for those of you who are actually reading this), I'm for neither candidate, even back in high school, I was always in the middle of the political spectrum leading a little towards conservative beliefs. To be quite frank, I don't give a damn about politics, because it's all a popularity contest of who's better looking (that's why JFK got elected). In the end, your vote won't count, you know why? Because it is all up to the electoral college (primarily made up of Congressmen) who vote for the President (At least that's what I've learned in high school and college political science classes). And that's another thing, READ your Constitutional given rights, people! There is nowhere in it that says the President makes the laws, or has much power in that matter (besides vetoing power). But furthermore, all it really says is it's just a title he holds to represent the country. If you really want to blame someone on war, peace, or whatever-the-heck, try finding out who your local congressman is and reach out to him/her to get your voice across government.<br />
<br />
All I'm saying is try to&nbsp;think TWICE before you get into that voting booth, and choose the best candidate that will fulfill your promised need(s).</div>
