This past week was yet another fine week for me in regard to a new line of show premieres on NBC, CBS, etc. networks. In addition to that, classes went well for week four of the semester. Anyhow, other news related is that I've been quite still interested in <a href="http://vimeo.com/12271865" target="_blank">Jack Dorsey</a>'s drawings of his creations and products, of Twitter and Square. Like even he said to an audience one time about developers should be able to put out their ideas on paper or even a whiteboard, in which I'm still starting to do to get in the good practices of being a programmer. Other than regarding about me improving myself as a decent developer, had my usual family prayer meeting at Syosset yesterday, went to church today, and kept track of the NFL season today.
