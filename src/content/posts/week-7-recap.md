This past week was truly an amazing and blessed week I've ever had (I talked about it in last post). Anyway, yesterday went out to a bachelor party dinner for Jebuchachan, with just the cousin bros. at the Ruth-Chris steakhouse, which was pretty good quality. Then, went out to bowling at the Sheridan Lanes, in Mineola, where I bowled pretty good about an 80 in each round and got home around midnight.<br /><br />Today, went to church, relaxed, studied for a math midterm tomorrow (still studying), and along with that watching School of Rock (one of my favorite movies). So, overall pretty amazing week turnout.
