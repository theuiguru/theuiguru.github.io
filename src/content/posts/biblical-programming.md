Recently, I found this interesting <a href="http://javascript.crockford.com/popular.html" target="_blank">article</a> on a javascript guru's website, and as I was browsing through it, I found that there were even programming languages back in biblical times, stated in the book of Genesis 11:1-9. He explains that "...in which some excellent engineering talent was applied to the task of building a city and a tower with which to unify the world." Also, "Designers who makes their language too complex will confuse the language, sayeth the LORD."
