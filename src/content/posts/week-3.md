Yeah, this past week was actually not bad, in which I did the usual on campus. On Thursday however, I actually missed all the NBC's shows that night, I was looking forward to, instead fell asleep earlier. Then, on Friday, watched it all on hulu, and I began to watch this new show, Glee (aired on Fox), which is pretty amazing and cheesy. It kind of brings me back to my old high school days.<br /><br />Anyway, yesterday went nowhere and spent the entire night home alone. Today, went to church (Chrisostomos Thirumini was chief celebrant). After church, stopped by at the Queens Burger King/Popeyes for lunch to take home, and then watched a little bit of football. So that's pretty much it for the weekly update!
