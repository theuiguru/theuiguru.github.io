I had a marvelous weekend. Starting with my family prayer meeting at my cousin's house, with usual stuff (Songs, Bible passages, discussion, prayer, etc.). Then, on Sunday, I actually went to my area MGOCSM Bible Study led by Rev. Dn. Gheevarughese John on "<em>A Conversation with an Athiest</em>". The bible study was great. Overall, I had fun this weekend...= )!!
