This past week was my first week of the semester, of my third year, at SUNY Old Westbury. I have some interesting classes with decent professors, such as Constitutional Law and Politics, Technical Communications, Discrete Math, and Data Structures and Algorithms. So, the first week turned out great, and considering that all my classes are in the evening now, from Monday through Thursday, and one on Saturdays as well. Anyway yesterday, went to dinner with my family cousins at this new place called "Famous Daves" in celebration of my sister's eighteenth birthday. And of course, went to church today and relaxed at home a bit.<br /><br />In any case, just felt like sharing something in regard to what I've learned something interesting in my constitutional law class in which my professor pointed it out to us regarding that there seems to be no explanation of what the judicial branch's power really is, being expressed in Article III of the Constitution, and it made me think that there's got to be somewhere in the Article that explains what the supreme court really does, as well in terms of power. Anyhow, I'm not going to delve into it, so I'll leave it at that for some people reading this to think about.<br /><br />In other news, there has been a video posted up on the youtube site which is hillarious and amusing, in which I first saw it at work about a month ago, and now the video has hit up to nearly three-million views, so go check it out entitled "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrWu13Uh2Yw" target="_blank">Huntsville Rapist Bed Intruder Song</a>".
