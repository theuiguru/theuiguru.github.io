Apparently, I have been delving more into front-end development and user experience design. Based on my previous contracting jobs, I have been playing around with the Internet more and more, especially with browser developer tools (i.e. Chrome and Firefox), and git. I was having trouble where to host my personal space on the web whether it be on Blogger, Github, Harp, etc. And I was trying a lot of different methods in which to make me a better developer.&nbsp;</div>

Like recently, I have been playing around with the Twitter Bootstrap 3 framework integration with Blogger based off of a bookmarked <a href="http://tudor-anghelina.blogspot.com/">link</a> I saved in my <a href="http://del.icio.us/cthomas1211">del.icio.us</a> account. I've searched and searched all throughout Google (for many days) for this solution. Over the past few months, I've realized that blogging is getting more common now more than ever whether it be through Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Medium, you get the deal, in which people can freely post content. Another alternative I turned to was messing around with the <a href="http://twitter.com/harpplatform">@HarpPlatform</a>&nbsp;and making boilerplate templates. Even last year, I installed nodejs and wrote my first "Hello World" program. What I definitely like the most is that majority of sites (or all) turn out to be static in the end until the user(s) uses the web application. It's like what the&nbsp;<a href="http://twitter.com/harpplatform">@HarpPlatform</a>&nbsp;says on their features page, "Static is the new dynamic". Furthermore, this whole site is using blogger code with twitter bootstrap framework embedded, plus used the same color scheme as the <a href="https://www.harp.io/features">Harp platform's features page</a>.</div>
