Today, I went to my MGOCSM Queens/Long Island/Brooklyn area bible study. We had our very own Rev.Dn.Daniel Mathai (aka Dennis) as our speaker. Today's bible study topic was about "<em>Discipleship</em>", talking about the lives of the Holy Apostles of Christ (including St. Paul), and the previous 13-day lent, which ended today. One of the key aspects of being a Disciple is <em>Faith</em>. Dn. Daniel pointed out two portions of the Bible which are Revelations 3:14-22 (explaining Lukewarm Christians) and the other, 1 Peter 3:8-22. Anyway, I had fun being there and it was a great experience learning more about the disciples.<br /><center><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 235px; height: 320px;" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiQchd3PG19cqw398q4W-j2PYSmFgt4sW_Y-y8tmyWNtujSL73PwcjGGZGdC0RizVR6OByu4GSBFPHWInzEsHvUKiUWuHTiq3Bk0bxGVlUjuOh45mAIYdRsQ9sdV_elu_IuqXJy/s320/disciples.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5342104936363533602"></center>
