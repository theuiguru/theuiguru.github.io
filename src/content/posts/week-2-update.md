This past week was another interesting week for me on campus, with classes and of course a welcome back barbeque and club fair. Also, a week of new premieres for a couple of shows on NBC that I've watched, especially Parks and Recreation, The Office, and a new show called Community. On Friday night, was once again home alone (along with Dinah), while parents went to Jersey (and came back that night as well). <br /><br />Yesterday, actually spent the whole day doing nothing, and for the rest of the evening went over to Swithin's house for the regular family prayer meeting, barbeque, and as a special treat, celebrated the 60th birthdays for his dad and Shanu and Sherry's dad. After that, watched again The Office, because of Shanu didn't get to see it on Thursday. I was actually impressed by Jay Sean and Russell Peters at their videos on youtube, very nice and hillarious. Today, went to church, and after church, went home to watch some football (Jets/Patriots and Steelers/Bears games). Amazing turnout by both the Jets and the Bears.
