I know I didn't update this blog in a month as I usually do, so figured I'd write about what happened these past few weeks, starting from where I left off which was week 3. I've been meaning to create a twitter account (instead of blogging), but then again not really a mobile user. Anyway, I've actually been getting used to my new school, hanging out with friends, browsing through some random videos and reading some new blog and twitter-feeds, plus learning some new programming languages on the side via youtube. On another note, getting into lenten season mode nowadays while reading all the Scripture readings, online devotionals, and special prayers.<br /><br />This past weekend, went to Philly with family and aunt from India to go visit some family there. For my first time in Philly, went to go see a movie with the cousins at the United Artist Theatres near their apartment, "Alice in Wonderland" starring Johnny Depp, which was an ok movie to watch. After the movie, went to Dunkin' Donuts, and spent the night. Then on Sunday, went to St. Gregorios, Philadelphia church to receive the Holy Qurbana for the fourth week in a row during GL (aka Great Lent). After that, went back to the apartments and spent some time there with the cousins until one cousin, Nathan, came around and things got really fun. So overall, the weekend was a blast there in Philly, wish I could go there like every month now.
