I recently went on a trip, with the MGOCSM youth, to St. Tikhon's Orthodox Theological Seminary, which is located in South Canaan, Pennsylvania. We all toured around the Monastery, bookstore, the seminarians' dorms (Inside is the St. John Chrysostom Indian Orthodox Chapel), and even a walk in the woods. St. Tikhon's Seminary is very beautiful. For lunch, we had Subway sandwiches and after that, the seminarians showed us a slideshow presentation of photos, along with a tour of the St. Tikhon's chapel. We also got a pamphlet and an icon of our Lord Jesus Christ. We all had fun and it was a blessed event.
