I have had an awesome weekend. First, on Friday, I went to see <em>Spider-Man 3</em> with my family at the Broadway Mall. Then, on Saturday, I went to the Brush Hollow theaters to see <em>Pirates of the Carribean 3</em> with my cousins which was like a three hour movie, and after that we went to the Carle Place Diner on Old Country Road and ate until like one in the morning. On Sunday, I went to church and celebrated the Pentecost, and then we went to my cousin's house for a surprise party for Kunjumolaunty (Syossetmami). We had fun and we ate pizza and watched the Cavs and Pistons game. It was really fun.
