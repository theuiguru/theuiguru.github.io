This past weekend, July 4-6, was absolutely amazing and spectacular. First, on Friday, I had a family barbeque at my house, which was pretty decent having the barbeque inside the garage because of the rain outside. Anyway, on Saturday, went to one of my parishioner's house for another barbeque, and then went off to Brush Hollow theatres to go see the movie, <em><strong>WALL-E</strong></em>, with all the cousins. <em><strong>WALL-E</strong></em> was boring in the beginning, but as the movie went on, it got interesting, hillarious, and romantic. After the movie, my cousins and I went to <em>Friendly's</em> to eat dinner. So anyway, today, went to church and after the service, there was a special graduation ceremony for all the class of 2008 graduates. I finally got an official Orthodox Study Bible (both Old and New Testament), given to all the high school seniors, blessed by the vicar and parish. Finally, went to a friend's house, talked and hung out, and ate pizza. Overall, this weekend was a blast and spectacular for me!
