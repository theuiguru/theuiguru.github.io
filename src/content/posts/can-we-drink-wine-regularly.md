In my sunday school class discussion today, my teacher was asking us a question, "<em>Are we allowed to drink wine regularly?</em>" Well, as we went around sharing our answers, most of us said "<em>No, but there are certain conditions.</em>" In my opinion, I was thinking about how we always drink the blood and body of our Lord every Sunday, so I guess it was okay. St. Paul writes in 1 Timothy 5:23 that, "<em>No longer drink only water, but use a little wine for your stomach's sake and your frequent infirmities.</em>" Also, in the parable of the Good Samaritan, it says that he put wine on the beaten Jew's wounds, and then put olive oil. In other words, wine is good to heal wounds and for the body as a whole.
