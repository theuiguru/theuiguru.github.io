It's that time again for the Super Bowl baby! New York Giants are facing the New England Patriots tomorrow (Sunday). I heard that some of the Giants players have the flu, but I guess they'll be over it. Also, in my economics class, we were discussing about how people go crazy over the super bowl (Game, commercials, food, etc.) Will it be an upset for the Patriots? Who knows? GO GIANTS (BIG BLUE)!! This year, 2008, it comes home to New York!!
