This past weekend was absolutely amazing.<br /><br />On Saturday, I actually drove back and forth to the Broadway Mall to go shopping for new clothes, at my new and favorite store: Hollister. Anyway, after a while, went home, then back to the hotel to refresh myself (including my family). Then, it was off to Syosset for Jabin's, and Roshan's, birthday party/barbeque. Got to talk and hang out with my really cool and loving family.<br /><br />Today, I again drove to church alone, yes that's right, through the local road. Even though there were only few people at church today, it was still a good English service. Also, I happened to hear Danielchemchan's sermons about New Sunday. After that, went home, and then back to the hotel to take some rest and do some work for school. Overall, I had another amazing and marvelous weekend, with my family!
